// It is with great enthusiasm that I write this letter of recommendation on behalf of Sophia, a truly exceptional and dedicated student. I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Sophia for the past three years in our small high school setting, where students are known and valued. Throughout her time here, Sophia has consistently demonstrated her diligence, responsibility, and a strong commitment to her academic pursuits and extracurricular activities.

// Sophia intends to study within the business field and has displayed a remarkable aptitude for learning and personal growth. Her dedication to her studies is evident in her approach to overcoming obstacles, particularly with challenging AP classes. Sophia sought assistance from teachers and invested extra time outside of school to ensure she understood the subjects in which she initially struggled. This determination and proactive attitude are qualities that will undoubtedly contribute to her success in a university setting.

// In addition to her academic achievements, Sophia has actively engaged in a wide range of extracurricular activities. She has been learning piano, participating in the Kumon program for additional math and reading practice, and taking virtual art classes. Sophia's involvement in the Chick-Fil-A Leadership program and her initiation of the International Travel Club in 9th grade demonstrates her ability to lead and collaborate with her peers. Furthermore, her participation in the Korean Club, Financial Opt-In program, Volunteer Club, and girls basketball team highlights her well-rounded interests and talents.

// Sophia's leadership abilities are not limited to specific titles, as she consistently takes on roles that benefit her school community. She served as a student culture leader from 2019 to 2021, assisting in the acclimation of incoming freshmen and allowing students to shadow her during school hours. Additionally, she has been a member of the National Honor Society since 2020.

// One particularly noteworthy accomplishment of Sophia's occurred during her junior year when she expressed a desire to take AP Chinese, a course not offered at our high school. Instead of allowing this setback to deter her, Sophia independently studied and prepared for the AP Chinese exam, ultimately earning a score of 5. This example perfectly encapsulates Sophia's perseverance and commitment to her education.

// In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Sophia for admission to Colorado State University. Her diligence, hard work, and sense of responsibility, combined with her strong leadership skills and dedication to her academic and extracurricular pursuits, make her an ideal candidate for your institution. I am confident that she will not only succeed but also thrive within the Colorado State University community.

// Sincerely,
// Valerie Wilkinson" </p>
